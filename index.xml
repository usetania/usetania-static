In the last few weeks, there&amp;rsquo;s a discussion between initiators of this project about the direction of Tania. We all agree that Tania should be more involving the community in the agriculture ecosystem around the world to promote precision agriculture practice. Because we believe precision agriculture can make farming more sustainable ecologically and economically. The world is too big for us to do it alone.</description>

There are some key skills and attributes to be a successful farmer, that are more important than others. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering farming as your business, I think you should &amp;ldquo;invest&amp;rdquo; in these skills.
1. Organisational Skills If you never manage your checkbook balance, you&amp;rsquo;ll be easier to get a crazy shock by your unorganised system. Farmers must keep all kinds of records accurately, regularly.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Succesful Farmer</title>

      <description>Since running Tanibox, I have met many farmers who are pretty successful in running their farming businesses. By having deep conversations with them, it&amp;rsquo;s not that they know how to grow pretty vegetables. It&amp;rsquo;s that these farmers have a deep understanding of how a business should work.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to this conclusion.
 If you can&amp;rsquo;t make a living by farming, then you&amp;rsquo;re NOT a great farmer. You might be a great grower, but you’re not a good farmer nor a successful one.</description>

      <description>Smart farming is an idea to cultivate crops with a combination of the latest technology and data analysis. The objective of it is to get more yields with few bad impacts on the environment than the conventional farming method.
How can we start doing smart farming? Is it expensive? These are common questions. We can start small without buying expensive equipment.
The first step is collecting data. We can start to gather data by using a simple tool like a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.</description>

      <description>This software is built with Go programming language. It means you will get an executable binary to run on your machine. You don&amp;rsquo;t need extra software like MAMP, XAMPP, or WAMP to run Tania, but you may need MySQL database if you choose to use it instead of SQLite (the default database.)
The easiest way to install Tania is using pre-built binaries for Windows (x64) and Linux (x64). You can download it from the release page.</description>

      <description>Tania current stable version is 1.5.1 was released in 2018. It is a total rewrite of the initial Tania that is written in PHP (Symfony framework). Version 1.5.1 uses Go lang and we will use it for the later version. We change the language because we want to make Tania easy to install in any machine&amp;ndash;on the cloud environment, on the NAS (Network Attached Storage), or even on the small device like Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>The overall architecture of Tania is built so it doesn’t rely on particular storage, protocol, or serialization format. Because it needs to be deployed to a different environment like Raspberry Pi, NAS QNAP, or the cloud like AWS. We name the Tania architecture as Modular Monolith as each domain share nothing.
